Background
Provide a brief background or context about Molly Rocket's claims in the video. Explain why you decided to conduct this benchmark analysis and what specific aspects you aimed to investigate.

Features
List the key features or functionalities of your benchmarking project:

Feature 1: Benchmarking tool for measuring performance.
Feature 2: Data collection and analysis.
Feature 3: Reporting and visualization of benchmark results.
Usage
Explain how users can use the benchmarking tool you've created to replicate your analysis or perform similar tests. Include any setup instructions, code examples, or usage guidelines.

bash
Copy code
```
$ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
$ cd your-repo
$ dotnet run --benchmark
```
Methodology
Describe the methodology you followed to conduct the benchmark analysis. This should include details on the benchmarks performed, the test environment, and any specific metrics or criteria you used to evaluate the claims.

Results
Present the results of your benchmark analysis. You can include data, charts, or comparisons to Molly Rocket's claims to highlight any discrepancies or confirmations. Be transparent about your findings.

Benchmarking Details
Provide additional details about the benchmarking process:

The first part of the video was benchmarked using code located in the FirstCleanCode class.
The second part of the video was benchmarked using code located in the SecondCleanCode class.
To maintain shape fidelity with the video, separate shapes were created for each benchmark.
Four additional cases were considered to assess best and worst-case scenarios for each part of the video, including BestCases and WorstCases for the first part and BestCases_ and WorstCases_ for the second part.
Molly Rocket's Claims
Regarding Molly Rocket's claims in the video:

The claim that polymorphism is worse than switch case is incorrect. In both parts of the video, the benchmark results indicate that polymorphism performs better than switch case.
The claim about the table-driven case is correct. The benchmark results show that the table-driven case consistently performs much better than both switch case and polymorphism in both parts of the video.
Contributing
